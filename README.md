virgo.fi-theme
==============

This theme is just still for testing and educational purpose only.

The theme was built on virgo-blank which is just a blank wordpress theme created by famed web designer and developer Chris Coyier. I only did some minor changes for the background as well as some CSS preprocessors. 

The full-fledged theme system is located in virgo.fi-theme which can be found at:

Here you can have a better view of how I implemented the theme. Basically I override the following php files:

404.php
header.php
style.css
single.php
screenshot.png

I then also added some new php files:

attachment.php

loading.gif
page-about.php (designed for the about page)
page-game.php (designed for the game page)
page-games.php (designed for the games page; games page is the page containing list of games, each game is a link to a game page that mentioned just above)
page-home.php (designed for the home page)
page-person.php (designed for the person page)

Some plugins that are critical and required to run the theme: contact-form-7, custom-post-background (with a little modification, included in the repository), qtranslate and slimbox
